A station id, when provided, should a WIGOS identifier long version, ie:
https://oscar.wmo.int/surface//index.html#/search/station/stationReportDetails/0-20000-0-10505

Ideally all relevant station ids should exist. At least one station id should be provided when the Is it possible to define when it is applicable? The best would be to
detect when a station identifier is missing? Any idea to it ?

When a station identifier is provided then it should be a VALID WIGOS
identifier url. This can be verified
