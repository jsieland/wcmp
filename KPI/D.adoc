== D. Valid Station Identifier

A station id when provided should a WIGOS identifier long version, ie:
https://oscar.wmo.int/surface//index.html#/search/station/stationReportDetails/0-20000-0-10505

Is it possible to define when it is applicable? The best would be to
detect when a station identifier is missing? Any idea to it ?

When a station identifier is provided then it should be a VALID WIGOS
identifier url. This can be verified
